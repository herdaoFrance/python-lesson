# Python Lesson: Live Blockchain Coding Using Python

Welcome to the Python lesson on live blockchain coding! In this session, we'll explore how Python can be used for Web3 development and smart contract deployment. We'll cover a simple transaction using the Web3.js library and the development of a smart contract using PyTeal.

## 1 - Simple Transaction using Web3.js Library

**Framework Development:** Truffle (Ganache)

**Programming Languages:** Python and JavaScript

To perform a simple transaction, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the required software installed: Truffle ( Ganache ), Python, and the Web3.js library.
[Ganache installation](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)

`pip install web3`

2. Complete the `web3_interaction.py` script with your information.
3. Run the code with the following command:
   `python web3_interaction.py`

## 2 - Development of Smart Contract using PyTeal

Install the Algokit package using the following command:
`pipx install algokit`

To verify the successful installation of Algokit, run:
`algokit --version`

Then, to set up your Algorand environment you can go through this documentation : [AlgoKit setup](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/algokit/)
